## Python Code to Fetch Stock Data

### Overview

This Python script fetches stock data from an API endpoint (`https://stocks.tradingvolatility.net/api/gex/levels`) for a list of stock symbols specified in a CSV file. The fetched data for each stock symbol is then stored in a dictionary.

### Libraries

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
```

- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to APIs.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and reading CSV files.

### Reading Stock Symbols from a CSV File

```python
# Read the CSV into a DataFrame
csv_filepath = 'Your Path'
df = pd.read_csv(csv_filepath)

# Convert the 'Stock_Symbols' column to a list of tickers
tickers = df['Stock_Symbols'].tolist()
```

- `csv_filepath`: The path to the CSV file containing the stock symbols.
- `df`: DataFrame containing the stock symbols.
- `tickers`: List of stock symbols obtained from the DataFrame.

### API Endpoint and Parameters

```python
# Define the API endpoint
api_endpoint = "https://stocks.tradingvolatility.net/api/gex/levels"
```

- `api_endpoint`: The API endpoint from which the stock data is fetched.

### Fetching Stock Data

```python
# Initialize a dictionary to store the results
results = {}

# Loop through the tickers and make a request for each
for ticker in tickers:
    params = {
        'username': 'Your_API_Key',  # Replace with your actual API key
        'ticker': ticker,
        'format': 'TRVIEW'
    }

    # Make the API request
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, params=params, headers={'Accept': 'application/json'})
    ...
```

- `results`: A dictionary to store the fetched data for each stock symbol.
- `params`: The parameters sent in the API request.
    - `username`: Your API username.
    - `ticker`: The stock symbol for which data is being fetched.
    - `format`: The format in which you want to receive the data.

### Handling API Responses

```python
    if response.status_code == 200:
        results[ticker] = response.text  # Store the raw response text for each ticker
    else:
        results[ticker] = f"Failed to fetch data: HTTP {response.status_code}"
```

- Checks the HTTP status code to determine if the API request was successful.
- Stores the API response in the `results` dictionary.

### Printing the Results

```python
# Print the results
for ticker, result in results.items():
    print(f"Results for {ticker}: {result}")
```

- Prints out the fetched stock data stored in the `results` dictionary.
